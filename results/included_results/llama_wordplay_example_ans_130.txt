Prompts: 
 Definition_prompt: You are a cryptic crosswords expert. I will give you a clue. As you know, every clue has two parts: a definition and wordplay. Please extract the wordplay type from this clue.
Here is a list of all possible wordplay types, and their descriptions:
- anagram: An anagram is a word (or words) that, when rearranged, forms a different word or phrase.
    Example: Ms Reagan is upset by the executives (8)
    The answer: Managers

- hidden word: The answer is found in the clue itself, amongst other words.
    Example: Confront them in the tobacco store (6)          
    The answer: Accost

- double definition:  Clues contain two meanings of the same word.  The words may be pronounced differently, but must be spelt the same.
    Example: Footwear for pack animals (5)
    The answer: Mules

- container: One word is placed inside another (or outside another) to get the answer.
    Example: Curse about the Maori jumper (7)
    The answer: Sweater

- assemblage: The answer is broken up into smaller parts and each syllable or part is given a separate clue.  These separate clues are then put together into one clue.
    Example:  Brash gets a Prime Minister employment, but it’s drudgery (6,4)  
    The answer: Donkey work
Only output the wordplay type.
Clue: {clue}
