let's break down the clue:

* definition: "achy shaking" (5,4)
* wordplay: "stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin"

the definition is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a type of condition or symptom. the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to the substances mentioned, which are all used to treat or alleviate certain conditions.

the wordplay is likely a form of anagramming or substitution. iodine, salt, and kaolin are all used to treat skin conditions, so the answer might be a type of skin condition.

using the wordplay, i'll try to anagram the substances to form a word that fits the definition. here's one possible solution:

answer: eczema,
clue: achy shaking stopped by iodine, salt and kaolin (5,4)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a type of skin condition that is alleviated by the substances mentioned. eczema is a type of skin condition that can cause achy or itchy sensations, and it is often treated with iodine, salt, and kaolin.
eczema
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "paid the bail for a sound woman" (5)
* wordplay: "for a sound woman"

the definition is "paid the bail for a sound woman", which suggests that the answer is a synonym of "paid the bail for a sound woman". the wordplay is "for a sound woman", which is a phrase that can be interpreted as "for a woman who is sound" or "for a woman who is whole".

the wordplay is telling us to take the phrase "for a sound woman" and use it to get to the answer. one possible interpretation is to take the phrase and split it into two parts: "for a sound" and "woman". the word "sound" can be used as a prefix to modify the word "woman", resulting in the word "sounder".

so, the answer is:

answer: sounder,
clue: paid the bail for a sound woman (5)
sounder
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "in germany, thin girls can eat this!" (8)
* wordplay: "in germany" is likely a red herring, and "thin girls" is a hint at the answer. the phrase "can eat this" suggests that the answer is a type of food.

the wordplay is likely a play on words, using the fact that "thin" sounds like "din" (a type of german restaurant). therefore, the answer is a type of food that is commonly served in a din (german restaurant).

answer: bread,
clue: in germany, thin girls can eat this! (8)
bread
let's break down the clue:

* wordplay: "partial to" (this is the instruction on how to get to the answer)
* number in parentheses: (5) (this indicates the number of letters in the answer)

the wordplay "partial to" suggests that the answer is a type of poetry, and the definition "old official" is a hint that the answer is related to a historical figure. putting it together, i think the answer is a type of poetry that an old official might be fond of.

the answer is: poem,
clue: old official partial to free verse (5)

poem is a type of poetry, and "free verse" is a style of poetry that is often associated with modern and contemporary poetry. the wordplay "partial to" suggests that the old official is fond of this style of poetry.

* number in parentheses: (5) (this indicates the number of letters in the answer)

the wordplay "partial to" suggests that the answer is a type of poetry, and the definition "old official" is a hint that the answer is related to a historical figure. putting it together, i think the answer is a type of poetry that an old official might be fond of.

the answer is: poem,

let's break down the clue:

* definition: "son's" (at the end of the clue)
* wordplay: "coarse-sounding" (indicates that the wordplay is related to the sound of the word)

the wordplay is likely a homophone, where the answer sounds like the definition "son's" but has a different meaning.

with the wordplay being a homophone, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a word that sounds like "son's" but has a different meaning. one possibility is the word "roans", which sounds like "son's" but is a type of horse.

answer: roans,
clue: coarse-sounding son's in the wilderness (7)
roans
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "turns up in chilly surroundings yet well received" (7)
* wordplay: "yet" is a common indicator of a wordplay, and "chilly surroundings" is likely a metaphorical description rather than a literal one.

the wordplay is likely a homophone or a pun. the phrase "chilly surroundings" could be replaced with a word that sounds similar, such as "frosty reception". the wordplay is telling us to replace "chilly" with "frosty".

the definition "well received" suggests that the answer is a positive thing, and the wordplay "turns up in" implies that the answer is something that appears or emerges.

putting it all together, i think the answer is:

answer: frosty,
clue: turns up in chilly surroundings yet well received (7)

the answer "frosty" fits the description, and the wordplay "chilly surroundings" becomes "frosty reception", which is a common idiomatic expression meaning a warm and enthusiastic welcome.
frosty
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "foreign currency racket" (5)
* wordplay: "completely disheartened auditor"

the wordplay suggests that the answer is not a literal foreign currency, but rather a word that is "completely disheartened" (i.e., made unhappy) by an auditor. this implies that the answer is a verb that means to disappoint or displease someone.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: riles,
clue: foreign currency racket completely disheartened auditor (5)

the verb "riles" means to make someone angry or upset, which fits with the wordplay. the definition "foreign currency racket" is a synonym of the answer, suggesting that the answer is a verb that is related to money or finance.
riles
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "the fellow apprehending one felon"
* wordplay: "apprehending" is a verb that means to catch or arrest someone, but it's also a word that can be split into "apprehend" and "ing". the wordplay is likely a reversal or a hidden word.
* number of letters: (5)

from the definition, we know the answer is a person who apprehends a felon. the wordplay suggests that we need to look for a word that is hidden or reversed within the phrase "apprehending one".

one possible solution is to take the phrase "apprehending one" and reverse the order of the words to get "one apprehending". this could be a person who is a "bailiff", which is a fellow who apprehends felons.

answer: bailiff,
clue: the fellow apprehending one felon (5)
bailiff
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "dames" is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a type of woman.
* wordplay: "popular with sailors" is the wordplay, which suggests that the answer is related to the sea or sailing.
* number of letters: (6)

with this information, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue.

the wordplay "popular with sailors" makes me think of a type of woman that sailors might be interested in. ah-ha! i think i've got it!

answer: anchors,
clue: dames popular with sailors? (6)

the wordplay is a play on words, using the phrase "popular with sailors" to hint at the answer being a type of anchor, which is a nautical term. the definition "dames" refers to the type of woman, and the answer is indeed a type of anchor, which is popular with sailors.
anchors
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "last year's leaders" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "entertained by regular journalist"
* number of letters: (6)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to a journalist, and the phrase "entertained by" implies that the journalist is the one doing the entertaining. the word "regular" could be a hint that the journalist is a regular contributor or columnist.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: precedents,
clue: last year's leaders entertained by regular journalist (6)

the definition "last year's leaders" suggests that the answer is a synonym for "previous leaders", and the wordplay implies that the journalist is the one who wrote about them. therefore, the answer is precedents, which means previous leaders or those who came before.

so, the answer is precedents, and the clue is: last year's leaders entertained by regular journalist (6).
precedents
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

* definition: "butcher" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "breaks bent pan" (instructions on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to a butcher breaking or cutting something, and "bent pan" might be a metaphorical or literal clue to the answer.

after some thought, i think i have it:

* the answer is "split", which is a synonym of "butcher" (as in, a butcher splits meat).
* the wordplay "breaks bent pan" suggests that the answer is a verb that means to split or break something, and "bent pan" is a metaphor for a split or broken object (like a broken pan).

so, the answer is:

answer: split,
clue: butcher breaks bent pan (7)
split
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "improved a carving" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "with direction" (this gives a hint on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay "with direction" suggests that the answer is related to a direction or a way of moving. the number in parentheses (4,2) indicates that the answer has 4 letters followed by 2 letters.

using the definition "improved a carving", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a verb that means to make a carving better or more precise. with the wordplay "with direction", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a verb that involves moving or guiding the carving tool in a specific direction.

with these hints, i'm going to take a stab at the answer:

answer: sawed,
clue: improved a carving with direction (4,2)

the answer "sawed" fits the definition "improved a carving" and the wordplay "with direction" suggests that the answer is related to the direction of the sawing motion.
sawed
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "a hairy man" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "speaking in child's play" (instructions on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to a phrase or expression that a child might use, rather than a literal description of a hairy man.

the phrase "speaking in child's play" is a hint that the answer is a homophone or a phrase that sounds like a child's phrase. a common phrase that children use is "a bear", which is a hairy creature.

the answer is likely to be "beary", which fits the definition "a hairy man" and the wordplay "speaking in child's play".

answer: beary,
clue: 'a hairy man', speaking in child's play (6)
beary
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "king" (at the end of the clue)
* wordplay: "bend down to" (indicates a reversal or a change in direction)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a word that, when reversed, forms a word related to a king. the answer is 6 letters long.

after some thought, i think i have the answer:

answer: rebel,
clue: bend down to king in chesterfield (6)

the word "rebel" is a synonym of "king" (in a sense, a rebel can be seen as a rival or opponent of a king). when you "bend down" to the word "rebel", you get the word "leber", which is a reference to the earl of chesterfield, a title of nobility.
rebel
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "message left in note"
* wordplay: "eg 'castle in the morning'"
* number of letters: (8)

the wordplay is a reference to a common idiomatic expression, "castle in the morning" being a metaphor for "in the air". this suggests that the answer is a phrase that is often written in the air, or left in a note.

the definition "message left in note" is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a type of message.

putting it together, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is:

answer: notelet,
clue: message left in note, eg "castle in the morning" (8)

the wordplay "eg 'castle in the morning'" is a hint that the answer is a type of note that is often written in the air, and the definition "message left in note" confirms that it's a type of message.
notelet
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "a weightwatchers' congress" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "congress" (indicates that the answer is a type of gathering or assembly)
* number of letters: (4)

from the wordplay, we can infer that the answer is a type of gathering related to weightwatchers. the definition suggests that the answer is a synonym of "congress", which is a gathering or assembly.

a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

* definition: "cimbalom" (the answer)
* wordplay: "dim clue reset by compiler finally"

the wordplay is telling us to "reset" the clue, which means we need to reverse the clue. the word "dim" is likely a hint that we need to reverse the clue, and "compiler" is a clever way of saying "compiler" (a person who compiles clues).

so, let's reverse the clue: "for 'cimbalom' (8)" becomes "mobilac icm" (8).

the answer is: answer: cimbalom,
clue: dim clue reset by compiler finally for "cimbalom" (8)
cimbalom
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "restraining democrat"
* wordplay: "in the chair" and "under influence of drugs"

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a phrase that can be interpreted in a more figurative sense. "in the chair" could mean "in a state of" or "under the influence of", and "under influence of drugs" could mean "under the influence of a drug".

putting it together, the wordplay is likely referring to a phrase that means "under the influence of a drug", but the drug is not a literal drug, but rather a person or a thing that has a strong influence.

the definition "restraining democrat" suggests that the answer is a phrase that describes a situation where a democrat is being restrained or controlled.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is:

answer: high on,
clue: in the chair, restraining democrat under influence of drugs (7)

the phrase "high on" means being under the influence of something, and "in the chair" could refer to being in a state of being controlled or restrained. the definition "restraining democrat" fits with the idea of a democrat being under the influence of something.
high on
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

**definition:** "horny beast" is the definition, which is a synonym of the answer. it's likely referring to a type of animal.

**wordplay:** "imagined finding garment ripped, models having fled" is the wordplay. it's a bit of a mouthful, but let's dissect it:

* "imagined finding" suggests that we need to imagine a scenario where the beast finds something.
* "garment ripped" implies that the something is a torn or ripped piece of clothing.
* "models having fled" suggests that the models (perhaps fashion models?) have run away or escaped.

putting it all together, we get: "imagined finding garment ripped" implies that the beast is finding a ripped garment, and "models having fled" suggests that the models have run away from the beast. this implies that the beast is a predator that has caught up with its prey (the models) and is now finding the garment that was ripped during the chase.

**answer:** given the definition "horny beast" and the wordplay, i think the answer is:

answer: ram,
clue: horny beast imagined finding garment ripped, models having fled (7)

the answer "ram" fits the definition, and the wordplay makes sense in the context of a ram (a type of horned beast) chasing and catching its prey, leaving a ripped garment behind.
ram
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "sword giving enemy cut to one leg" (4)
* wordplay: "giving" and "to one leg"

the definition is "sword giving enemy cut to one leg", which is a synonym of the answer. the wordplay is "giving" and "to one leg", which suggests that we need to take the first letter of the word "giving" and the last letter of the word "to one leg" to get the answer.

the word "giving" starts with the letter "g", and the word "to one leg" ends with the letter "g". therefore, the answer is:

answer: legs,
clue: sword giving enemy cut to one leg (4)

the answer is "legs", which fits the definition and the wordplay.
legs
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "very cutting, but inviting"
* wordplay: "riposte" (which means a quick, witty response, often used in fencing)

the wordplay suggests that we need to think creatively about the definition. "very cutting" could refer to something that is sharp or incisive, but "inviting" suggests that it's also appealing or attractive.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue. here's my answer:

answer: sarcasm,
clue: very cutting, but inviting riposte (3,5)

the wordplay is that "riposte" is a type of witty response, and "sarcasm" is a form of speech that is often used to be cutting or sharp, but also inviting or appealing in a way. the numbers (3,5) indicate that the answer has 3 letters followed by 5 letters, which fits with the word "sarcasm".
sarcasm
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "pays for food" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "after treasurer cleared out"
* number of letters: (6)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to the treasurer clearing out, which implies that the answer is something that is left over or remaining after the treasurer has taken out the funds. the definition "pays for food" suggests that the answer is a type of payment.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: tipps,
clue: pays for food after treasurer cleared out (6)

the wordplay "after treasurer cleared out" suggests that the answer is something that is left over or remaining after the treasurer has taken out the funds. the definition "pays for food" suggests that the answer is a type of payment. putting the two together, i think the answer is tipps, which is a type of payment (a tip) that is left over or remaining after the treasurer has taken out the funds.
tipps
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "poet's round" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "very one just cited" (instructions on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a type of round that is very much like the one just mentioned in a poem. the word "cited" implies that the poem is being referenced.

the answer is likely a type of round that is often mentioned in poetry, and the definition "poet's round" gives us a hint. a common type of round mentioned in poetry is a "ode".

so, the answer is:

answer: ode,
clue: poet's round - very one just cited (4)

the number in parentheses, (4), indicates that the answer has 4 letters.
ode
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "academic sinecures" (the answer is related to academic positions)
* wordplay: "(4,6)" (the numbers indicate that the answer is a compound word with 4 letters and 6 letters)

the wordplay is likely a combination of two words. the "4" suggests that the first part of the answer is a 4-letter word, and the "6" suggests that the second part is a 6-letter word.

a possible solution is that the 4-letter word is "teas" (a common abbreviation for a type of academic position) and the 6-letter word is "profess" (a type of academic position). combining the two, we get:

answer: teachers,
clue: academic sinecures? (4,6)

so, the answer is "teachers", which fits the definition of "academic sinecures".
teachers
let's break down the clue:

* definition: girl
* wordplay: "rejected in family rebellion"

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a word that is related to a girl, but is not the girl itself. the phrase "rejected in family rebellion" implies that the answer is something that is rejected or opposed to the family.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a word that means "daughter", but with a twist. the wordplay suggests that the answer is something that is rejected or opposed to the family, so i'm going to look for a word that means "daughter" but with a negative connotation.

after some thought, i think i have it:

answer: daisy,
clue: girl rejected in family rebellion (5)

the word "daisy" is a type of flower, but it's also a nickname for a girl. the wordplay suggests that the answer is a girl, but one that is rejected or opposed to the family, which could be interpreted as a "daisy" (a flower) being rejected in a family rebellion.

please let me know if this is correct or not!
daisy
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "on which" suggests that the answer is a location or a place.
* wordplay: "the unemployed needed drink or warm brew before church" is a phrase that seems unrelated to the definition at first glance. however, it's likely that the wordplay is a play on words, using the phrase to hint at a specific type of location.
* numbers in parentheses: (6,5) indicates that the answer has 6 letters followed by 5 letters.

with this analysis, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

the wordplay "drink or warm brew" suggests that the answer is a location where people might have a drink or a warm brew before church. this makes me think of a "café" or a "café church", but that doesn't quite fit the 6-5 letter pattern.

however, what if the wordplay is hinting at a specific type of location that serves drinks or warm brews? ah-ha! what if the answer is a "sunday roast"? it's a type of location where people might have a drink or a warm brew before church, and it fits the 6-5 letter pattern.

so, here's my answer:

answer: sunday roast,
clue: on which the unemployed needed drink or warm brew before church (6,5)

let me know if i'm correct or not!
sunday roast
let's break down the clue:

* definition: australian birds (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "scrub duds" (this is the wordplay that gives a hint on how to get to the answer)
* number of letters: (5,7)

the wordplay "scrub duds" is a phrase that means "old clothes" or "rags". it's likely that the answer is a type of australian bird that is often associated with scrubby or rugged terrain.

using the definition "australian birds" and the wordplay "scrub duds", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a type of bird that is often found in scrubby areas. one possibility is the "emu-wren" (5 letters: emuw) and the "bristlebird" (7 letters: bristleb).

so, the answer is:

answer: emu-wren bristlebird,
clue: australian birds scrub duds (5,7)
emu-wren bristlebird
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "for all to see" (5,3)
* wordplay: "in the navy"

the definition "for all to see" suggests that the answer is a synonym of "public". the wordplay "in the navy" is a hint that we need to modify the word "public" in some way.

a possible solution is to take the word "public" and replace the "p" with an "n" to get "nublic", which doesn't make sense. however, if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "c" to the end, we get "nublic" becomes "nublic", which is not a valid word.

but wait, what if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "ic" to the end, we get "nublic" becomes "publicic", which is not a valid word either.

ah-ha! what if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "ic" to the end, but instead of making it "publicic", we make it "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes

* wordplay: "in the navy"

the definition "for all to see" suggests that the answer is a synonym of "public". the wordplay "in the navy" is a hint that we need to modify the word "public" in some way.

a possible solution is to take the word "public" and replace the "p" with an "n" to get "nublic", which doesn't make sense. however, if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "c" to the end, we get "nublic" becomes "nublic", which is not a valid word.

but wait, what if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "ic" to the end, we get "nublic" becomes "publicic", which is not a valid word either.

ah-ha! what if we take the first 5 letters "nubli" and add the 3 letters "ic" to the end, but instead of making it "publicic", we make it "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes "nublic" becomes

let's break down the clue:

* definition: "dubious moment" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "to go topless"
* number of letters: (4)

the wordplay "to go topless" suggests that the answer is a phrase or a verb that means to remove something, possibly related to clothing. the definition "dubious moment" implies that the answer is a moment of uncertainty or hesitation.

considering the wordplay and definition, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: waver,
clue: dubious moment to go topless (4)

the wordplay "to go topless" could be interpreted as "to take off" or "to remove", which fits with the definition "dubious moment" as a moment of hesitation or uncertainty. the answer "waver" fits the description, as it means to hesitate or be uncertain, and it has 4 letters.

so, the answer is: waver.
waver
let's break down the clue:

* definition: uncommon pronoun
* wordplay: (5,2)

the wordplay is indicating that the answer is a 5-letter word followed by a 2-letter word. this is a common type of wordplay in cryptic crosswords, where the answer is a compound word or phrase.

using this information, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is:

answer: itis, clue: uncommon pronoun (5,2)

the definition "uncommon pronoun" suggests that the answer is a pronoun that is not commonly used in everyday language. the wordplay "5,2" indicates that the answer is a compound word or phrase, with a 5-letter word followed by a 2-letter word.

the answer "itis" fits this description, as it is an uncommon pronoun that is often used in formal or technical writing. the 5-letter word "itis" is followed by the 2-letter word "is", which is a common way to form a compound word or phrase.

please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other answers that fit the definition and wordplay.
itis clue: uncommon pronoun (52)
let's break down the clue:

* definition: what's worn by amazons as custodians? (10)
* wordplay: none explicitly stated, but we can infer that it's a play on words.

the definition is "what's worn by amazons as custodians?", which suggests that the answer is something that amazons wear. the wordplay is likely a pun or a clever twist on the word.

given the length of the answer is 10 letters, i'm going to take a stab at it. amazons are known for being warriors, and custodians are often associated with guarding or protecting something. with that in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the wordplay is a play on the word "helmets".

the answer could be "helmets", which is worn by amazons as warriors, and also fits the definition of custodians as guardians.

answer: helmets,
clue: what's worn by amazons as custodians? (10)
helmets
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "tries hard" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "with a cereal" (gives instructions on how to get to the answer)
* number/s in parentheses: (3,1,2) (indicates the number of letters in the answer)

the wordplay "with a cereal" suggests that we need to think about a cereal that is often associated with trying hard or making an effort. one such cereal is oat.

the definition "tries hard" is a synonym of the answer, which is oat.

answer: oat,
clue: tries hard with a cereal (3,1,2)
oat
let's break down the clue:

"it's suitable in public (8)"

* definition: "it's suitable" is likely a synonym for the answer, which means the answer is something that is acceptable or proper in public.
* wordplay: "in public" is not a literal instruction, but rather a phrase that suggests we need to manipulate the answer in some way. in cryptic crosswords, "in" often indicates reversal, and "public" might be a hint to look for a word that is related to the public domain or a public place.

with this analysis, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: decorum,
clue: it's suitable in public (8)

the wordplay suggests that we need to reverse the word, which is a common technique in cryptic crosswords. the definition "it's suitable in public" implies that the answer is something that is proper or acceptable in public. decorum is a noun that refers to the rules of behavior in polite society, which is suitable in public. reversing the word decorum gives us the answer murcoed, but since the answer has 8 letters, i'm going to take a chance and assume that the correct answer is actually decorum itself, which fits the definition and the wordplay.
decorum
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "injure" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "a black beetle" (this is the non-literal part that gives a hint about the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to a black beetle, but it's not a direct reference. instead, it might be a word that sounds like "black beetle" or has a similar sound.

with the definition "injure" and the wordplay "a black beetle", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a word that sounds like "black beetle" but is actually a verb that means to injure. one possible answer that fits is "smite".

answer: smite,
clue: injure a black beetle (6)
smite
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "cabinet minister" (this is likely the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "provides rally in disaster"
* number of letters: (4,5,4)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is not a literal cabinet minister, but rather a phrase that a cabinet minister might provide in a disaster. the word "rally" is a key part of the wordplay, as it can also mean to give a speech or a pep talk.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: emergency situation speech,
clue: cabinet minister provides rally in disaster (4,5,4)

the answer is a phrase that a cabinet minister might provide in a disaster, which is an "emergency situation speech". the numbers in parentheses (4,5,4) match the length of the answer.
emergency situation speech
let's break down the clue:

"one way to get team something in a pie (9)"

* definition: "get team something in a pie" is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a verb.
* wordplay: "one way to" suggests that the answer is a phrase or a way of doing something, rather than a direct object. the phrase "get team something in a pie" is likely a metaphorical expression.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: assemble,
clue: "one way to get team something in a pie (9)"

the wordplay is that "get team something in a pie" is a metaphor for assembling a team, like a team of ingredients in a pie. the answer is the verb "assemble", which fits the 9-letter length.

let me know if i'm correct!
assemble
let's break down the clue:

* definition: advertising
* wordplay: "in advance"

the wordplay "in advance" suggests that we need to think about something that is done before something else. in this case, "advertising" is often done before an event or a product launch.

the answer is likely a verb that means to advertise something before it happens. with the definition "advertising" and the wordplay "in advance", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is:

answer: promote,
clue: advertising in advance (9)

the answer "promote" fits the definition "advertising" and the wordplay "in advance", as it means to advertise or publicize something before it happens.
promote
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "oddball" is the definition, which is a synonym of the answer.
* wordplay: "wants to perform on" is the wordplay, which suggests that the answer is a type of performance or activity that an oddball might want to do on a dam.
* number in parentheses: (6) indicates that the answer has 6 letters.

using the definition and wordplay, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: damper,
clue: oddball wants to perform on dam (6)

the wordplay "wants to perform on" suggests that the answer is a type of performance or activity that an oddball might want to do on a dam. given the definition "oddball", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a type of music performance. a damper is a musical term that refers to a device that reduces the sound of a stringed instrument. an oddball might want to perform a damper on a dam, perhaps as a form of avant-garde music.

so, the answer is: damper.
damper
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "with puzzle" (indicates that the answer is a verb)
* wordplay: "grow increasingly furious"

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a verb that means to become increasingly furious, but in a more clever way. the phrase "grow increasingly furious" can be interpreted as "get more worked up" or "get more riled up".

using this interpretation, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a verb that means to become more agitated or upset. one possible answer that fits the description is "seethe".

answer: seethe,
clue: grow increasingly furious with puzzle (8)
seethe
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "no good at making pudding" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: (4)

the wordplay is likely a play on words, and the number in parentheses indicates the length of the answer is 4 letters.

a possible interpretation of the wordplay is that "making pudding" is a phrase that sounds like "making up", which is a common idiom meaning "to fabricate" or "to invent". this could be a hint to look for a word that means "bad at inventing" or "bad at making things up".

with this in mind, a possible answer is:

answer: rote,
clue: no good at making pudding (4)

the definition "no good at making pudding" is a synonym of the answer "rote", which means "unoriginal" or "uncreative", implying someone who is not good at inventing or making things up.
rote
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "source of money"
* wordplay: "atm george misused"

the wordplay is a play on words, using the name "george" to refer to a type of atm (automated teller machine), and "misused" to indicate that the atm is being used in a way that's not its intended purpose.

using the definition and wordplay, we can infer that the answer is a type of atm that is often used to access money. a common type of atm that comes to mind is a "cash machine".

answer: cash machine,
clue: atm george misused as source of money (9)
cash machine
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "mason's fermented juice" (the answer is a synonym of this phrase)
* wordplay: "mason's" is a hint that the answer is related to a mason (a person who works with stone), and "fermented juice" is a hint that the answer is a type of drink.

the wordplay is likely a play on words, using the idea of a mason's "juice" (i.e., mortar) to get to the answer.

using the wordplay, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a type of drink that is made with mortar (the binding agent used in masonry). one possibility is that the answer is "wine", which is a fermented juice.

so, the answer is:

answer: wine,
clue: mason's fermented juice? (5)
wine
let's break down the clue:

* definition: expression of surprise
* wordplay: at topless winnie
* number of letters: (3)

the wordplay "at topless winnie" is a hint that we need to modify the word "winnie" in some way. since winnie is a reference to winnie the pooh, a topless winnie might be a play on words. a topless winnie could be a "pooh" without the "p", which is a common abbreviation for "poor".

using this wordplay, we can extract the answer:

answer: ahh,
clue: expression of surprise at topless winnie (3)

the answer is "ahh", which is an expression of surprise, and it has 3 letters.
ahh
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "band crew/outfit leaders on road"
* wordplay: "useful for light adjustment"

the definition suggests that the answer is related to a group of people who lead a band or outfit on a road, possibly referring to a musical band or a military unit.

the wordplay "useful for light adjustment" is a hint that the answer is related to a type of adjustment that is useful for controlling light. this could be a play on words, as "light" has multiple meanings.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: roadies,
clue: band crew/outfit leaders on road - useful for light adjustment (4,4)

the wordplay "useful for light adjustment" suggests that the answer is related to adjusting light, and "roadies" is a term for the crew that sets up and operates the equipment for a band on tour. the word "roadies" also has a double meaning, as it can refer to the adjustment of lights on a stage.

the answer has 4 letters in the first part and 4 letters in the second part, which matches the given length.
roadies
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "top man" and "first place" suggest that the answer is a synonym for "winner".
* wordplay: "secures" is a verb that implies taking or getting something, and "for author" is a phrase that could be interpreted as a possessive phrase, as in "for the author of a book". this suggests that the wordplay is a form of anagramming or rearranging letters.

using this information, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

* rearrange the letters in "author" to get "routah", which doesn't seem to fit the definition.
* wait, what if i remove the "h" from "author"? that gives me "routa", which is close to "route", but not quite there.
* ah-ha! what if i add a "w" to "routa" to get "route"? that fits the definition of "winner"!

so, the answer is:

answer: route,
clue: top man secures first place for author (7)

let me know if i'm correct!
route
let's break down the clue:

* definition: turkish leader (6)
* wordplay: about to conclude the business

the wordplay suggests that the answer is not a literal turkish leader, but rather a phrase that is related to concluding business. the phrase "about to conclude the business" implies that the answer is a verb phrase that means to finish or wrap up a meeting or transaction.

using this interpretation, i think the answer is:

answer: sitin,
clue: turkish leader about to conclude the business (6)

the wordplay is a play on words, using the phrase "sit in" (meaning to take a seat) and replacing the "i" with "in" to get the turkish leader "sitin", which is a reference to the turkish leader mustafa kemal atatürk, also known as atatürk, who is often referred to as "atatürk" which sounds like "at the seat" or "sitting in".
sitin
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "motor enthusiast" (synonym of the answer)

* number of letters: 10

the wordplay "modifies other pedal" suggests that the answer is a type of pedal that is modified or altered in some way. the definition "motor enthusiast" implies that the answer is related to cars or motors.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue. here's my answer:

answer: cyclist,
clue: motor enthusiast modifies other pedal (10)

the wordplay "modifies other pedal" suggests that the answer is a type of pedal that is modified or altered in some way. in this case, a motor enthusiast (cyclist) modifies the pedal of a bicycle. the answer cyclist fits the 10-letter length and the definition "motor enthusiast" matches the clue.

* definition: "missing" (6)
* wordplay: "star surprisingly is over a year"

the wordplay is a play on words, suggesting that the answer is related to the phrase "over a year", but not literally. the word "star" is likely a reference to the star symbol (*).

the definition "missing" suggests that the answer is a synonym of "missing", which is likely "late".

the wordplay "is over a year" can be interpreted as "is a year late", which is a common phrase used to describe something that is overdue.

putting it all together, the answer is:

answer: late,
clue: star surprisingly is over a year missing (6)
late
let's break down the clue:

the wordplay is a homophone, where the answer sounds like "worn" when spoken. the definition is "one of the stones", which is a synonym of the answer.

using the wordplay, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a name of a rolling stone, and the wordplay is a homophone of "worn". after some thought, i think i have it:

answer: mick,
clue: one of the stones appearing worn - affected by the drink?

the answer is mick, as in mick jagger, a member of the rolling stones. the wordplay is that "mick" sounds like "worn" when spoken.
mick

the wordplay "in the bush" is a common cryptic clue technique called "container" or "location". it's indicating that the answer is a word that is contained within another word, and the "bush" is the container.

the definition "see animal go wild" suggests that the answer is a verb, and the wordplay "in the bush" is telling us to look for a verb that is contained within the word "wild".

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is "beseech", which is a verb that means "to implore or beg" and is contained within the word "wild".

answer: beseech,
clue: see animal go wild in the bush (8)
beseech
let's break down the clue:

given the definition and wordplay, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue.

answer: charity,
clue: figure seizing hotel involved in fund-raiser (8)

the wordplay is suggesting that the answer is a type of organization that seizes or takes control of funds, which is a charity. the "hotel involved in fund-raiser" part is a red herring, but it's meant to misdirect us from the more literal meaning of the definition.

the answer "charity" fits the given length of 8 letters, and it makes sense in the context of the wordplay.
charity
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "the old racer" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "racing around italy" (giving instructions on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to italy, and the definition is "the old racer". this implies that the answer is a type of vehicle that was popular in italy in the past.

using this information, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a "ferrari", which is a well-known italian sports car brand.

answer: ferrari,
clue: the old racer racing around italy? (10)
ferrari
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "what mrs sprat might do with rabbit" (the definition is at the beginning of the clue)
* wordplay: "might do with" is a phrase that suggests an action, and "rabbit" is a noun. the wordplay is likely a verb-noun combination, where "rabbit" is being used as a noun, and the verb is being hidden in the phrase.

given the definition and wordplay, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

* definition: "what mrs sprat might do with rabbit" = cook
* wordplay: "might do with" suggests an action, and "rabbit" is a noun. i'm going to take the verb "cook" and combine it with "rabbit" to get the phrase "cook rabbit".

let's break down the clue:

"carry on in the theatre (7)"

* definition: "carry on" is a synonym of the answer, which means the answer is likely a verb.
* wordplay: "in the theatre" is not a literal instruction, but rather a hint that the wordplay involves a theatrical theme.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

the wordplay is likely a play on words, using a theatrical term. "carry on" is a phrase that can also mean to continue or prolong something, which is a common phrase used in theatre. the wordplay is probably using this phrase to create a new word.

a possible solution is:

clue: carry on in the theatre (7)

the wordplay is using the phrase "carry on" to create the word "acton", which is a verb that means to continue or prolong something, fitting the definition.
acton
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "refashioning citadel walls" (9)
* wordplay: "double up"

the wordplay "double up" suggests that we need to double the letters of the answer. this is a common type of wordplay in cryptic crosswords.

the definition "refashioning citadel walls" gives us a hint about the meaning of the answer. a citadel is a strong fortress or stronghold, and "refashioning" implies changing or altering something.

with this in mind, let's think about what it means to "double up" the letters of the answer. one possibility is that we need to double the letters of a word that means "to fortify" or "to strengthen". this could be a word that is related to building or construction.

after some thought, i think i have a possible answer:

answer: redouble,
clue: double up refashioning citadel walls (9)

the word "redoouble" means to fortify or strengthen something, and it fits the given length of 9 letters. the wordplay "double up" suggests that we need to double the letters of the answer, which is exactly what we do when we "redoouble" something.

please let me know if this is correct or not!
redouble
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

**definition:** "feel sorry" (6)

**wordplay:** "when soldiers get to guard roundhead"

the wordplay is a clever play on words. "roundhead" is a historical term for a puritan, and "get to guard" sounds like "get to the head". this suggests that we need to take the first letter of the word "roundhead" to get to the answer.

**answer:** sympathize,
clue: feel sorry when soldiers get to guard roundhead (6)

the answer is sympathize, which fits the definition "feel sorry" and has 8 letters (not 6, i apologize for the mistake!).
** sympathize
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "irritates" (which is a synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "spaniel's head" (which is a metaphorical expression, not a literal one)
* wordplay instruction: "which is uncalled for" (which suggests that the wordplay is a play on words, and the answer is not what it seems)

putting it all together, i think the wordplay is a play on words, where "spaniel's head" is a phrase that sounds like a word that means "irritates". the phrase "which is uncalled for" suggests that the answer is not a literal spaniel's head, but rather a word that sounds like it.

with that in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the wordplay is a homophone, where the phrase "spaniel's head" sounds like the word "scandal's head", but the answer is actually the word "scandal".

so, the answer is:

answer: scandal,
clue: irritates spaniel's head, which is uncalled for (8)
scandal
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "temporarily relocate"
* wordplay: "help"

the wordplay "help" is likely a homophone, which means it's a word that sounds the same when spoken as another word. in this case, the wordplay is probably "shelf".

so, the answer is a word that means "temporarily relocate" and sounds like "shelf". one possible answer is:

answer: shift,
clue: temporarily relocate help (6)

the answer "shift" fits the definition "temporarily relocate" and the wordplay "help" is a homophone of "shelf".
shift
let's break down the clue:

"coming to no conclusion (7)"

* definition: "coming to no conclusion" is a synonym of the answer, which means the answer is likely a word related to not reaching a conclusion or decision.
* wordplay: the wordplay is "coming to no conclusion", which suggests that the answer is a word that is often used to describe the act of not reaching a conclusion.

using the wordplay, i'm going to take a closer look at the phrase "coming to no conclusion". the phrase "coming to" is a common idiomatic expression that means "reaching" or "arriving at". the wordplay is suggesting that the answer is a word that is often used to describe the act of not reaching a conclusion, which is "stalemate".

so, the answer is:

answer: stalemate,
clue: coming to no conclusion (7)
stalemate
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "rising artist"
* wordplay: "ignoring society, matured"
* number of letters: (4)

the wordplay "ignoring society, matured" suggests that we need to ignore the word "society" and focus on the word "matured". the word "matured" can be interpreted as "aged", which is a synonym of "matured".

the wordplay is telling us to take the word "aged" and modify it to get the answer. one possible modification is to remove the "g" from "aged" to get the word "ade", which is a common suffix in the name of a famous artist.

answer: ade,
clue: rising artist, ignoring society, matured (4)
ade
let's break down the clue:

"brilliance of one of elgar's variations (5)"

* definition: brilliance (5 letters)
* wordplay: "of one of elgar's variations"

the wordplay suggests that we need to think about elgar's variations, which are a set of musical compositions. the phrase "of one of" implies that we need to take a part of elgar's variations, rather than the whole thing.

a possible solution is to take the first letter of each word in the title of one of elgar's variations, which is "enigma". the first letter of each word in the title "enigma variations" spells out "enig", which is a synonym of "brilliance".

answer: enig,
clue: brilliance of one of elgar's variations (5)
enig
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "son being corrupted" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "in drink" (this gives a hint on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay "in drink" suggests that we need to think of a word that is related to drinking, and the definition "son being corrupted" implies that the answer is a verb.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is "soaked", which fits the definition "son being corrupted" and the wordplay "in drink".

answer: soaked,
clue: think of son being corrupted in drink (8)
soaked
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "temporary work" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "welcomed by young boxer" (this is the non-literal part that gives a hint on how to get to the answer)
* number of letters: (3,2) = 5 letters

from the wordplay, we can infer that the answer is related to a young boxer, and the word "welcomed" might be a hint to look for a word that is often welcomed or accepted by a young boxer. one possibility is that the answer is a type of "sparring" (temporary work) that a young boxer might engage in.

using this idea, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is "spar2". the definition "temporary work" fits, and the wordplay "welcomed by young boxer" suggests that the answer is a type of activity that a young boxer might engage in.

answer: spar2,
clue: temporary work welcomed by young boxer? (3,2)
spar2
let's break down the clue:

"name and return address in america (3)"

* definition: "name and return address" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "in america" (this gives a hint about the wordplay)

the wordplay is likely a reference to the fact that in the united states, a "return address" is often written in the format "name, street address, city, state, zip code". the wordplay is suggesting that we need to extract the first part of this format, which is the "name".

the answer is likely a 3-letter word, which is a common abbreviation for a name.

answer: usa,
clue: name and return address in america (3)
usa
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "where one is involved as an ex-president" (10)
* wordplay: none explicitly stated, but we can infer that it's a play on words.

the definition suggests that the answer is a place where an ex-president is involved, which could be a country, a building, or an institution.

the wordplay is likely a pun or a double meaning. since the clue mentions "one" and "ex-president", we can think of a word that has a connection to both.

a possible solution is that the answer is "state", which is a place where an ex-president is involved (as in, a state in the united states). the wordplay is that "one" is a homophone for "won", as in, a state that has been won or governed by an ex-president.

answer: state,
clue: where one is involved as an ex-president (10)
state
let's break down the clue:

"bird of prey (5)"

* definition: "bird of prey" is the definition, which is a synonym of the answer.
* wordplay: the wordplay is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it's a type of wordplay that involves manipulating the letters in some way.

since the answer has 5 letters, i'll take a closer look at the wordplay. one possibility is that the wordplay involves a type of anagram or reversal. let's try to find a bird of prey that has a wordplay that fits this description.

after some thought, i think i have a possible solution:

answer: eagle,
clue: "bird of prey (5)"

the wordplay is that the letters in the word "eagle" can be rearranged to spell "leage", which is a type of bird of prey. the definition "bird of prey" matches the answer, and the wordplay involves an anagram.

please let me know if this is correct or if i need to try again!
eagle
let's break down the clue:

* definition: country girl (4)
* wordplay: briefly eating duck

the wordplay suggests that the answer is not a literal country girl eating a duck, but rather a word that is related to a country girl and a duck in a more abstract sense.

the wordplay "briefly eating duck" could be interpreted as a play on words, where "duck" is not the food being eaten, but rather a part of the word that needs to be removed or modified to get the answer.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is "maid", which is a type of country girl and also a word that can be modified to remove the "duck" part to get the answer.

answer: maid,
clue: country girl briefly eating duck (4)
maid
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "found out" (at the beginning of the clue)
* wordplay: "such appliances are dangerous" (the phrase "such appliances" is likely a red herring, and "are dangerous" is a hint that the answer is a type of appliance)
* number of letters: (9)

the wordplay suggests that we need to think creatively about what kind of appliances are dangerous. one possible interpretation is that the answer is a type of appliance that is often found out (discovered) to be dangerous, rather than the appliance itself being inherently dangerous.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: explodes,
clue: found out such appliances are dangerous (9)

the definition "found out" suggests that the answer is something that is discovered or revealed, and the wordplay "such appliances are dangerous" hints that the answer is a type of appliance that is often found to be explosive. the answer "explodes" fits the 9-letter length and meets the definition and wordplay requirements.
explodes
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

* definition: "to do test again" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "i take five outside" (this is the less literal part that gives a hint on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay "i take five outside" suggests that we need to take the number 5 and do something with it. one possible interpretation is that we need to "take 5" as in "take away 5" or "minus 5". and "outside" could mean "before" or "prior to".

so, the wordplay is telling us to subtract 5 from something.

the definition "to do test again" suggests that the answer is a verb.

putting it all together, i think the answer is:

answer: retest,
clue: i take five outside to do test again (5)

the verb "retest" means to do a test again, and if we subtract 5 from the beginning of the word, we get "retest".
retest
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "midsummer day" is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a date or a time period.
* wordplay: "ends with a group of sailors" suggests that the answer is a date that ends with a word related to sailors.

given the length of the answer is 3 letters, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is "eve", which is a common abbreviation for "evening", and also ends with the word "eve", which is a group of sailors (a reference to the eve of the may eve, a traditional term for the night before may day, which is often associated with sailors).

answer: eve,
clue: midsummer day ends with a group of sailors (3)
eve
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "place order" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "getting from pick-up to destination, showing self-possession"
* number of letters: 6

the wordplay suggests that we need to think creatively about the phrase "getting from pick-up to destination". one possible interpretation is that "pick-up" refers to a pickup truck, and "destination" refers to a place where the truck is headed. "showing self-possession" could mean being in control of the truck.

with this interpretation, the wordplay could be suggesting that we need to think about a phrase that means "to drive" or "to navigate", which is a synonym of "place order".

putting it all together, i think the answer is:

answer: steer,
clue: place order, getting from pick-up to destination, showing self-possession (6)

the definition "place order" matches the synonym "steer", which means to guide or direct something (in this case, a vehicle). the wordplay "getting from pick-up to destination, showing self-possession" suggests the idea of steering a vehicle from one place to another, which requires self-possession and control.
steer
let's break down the clue:

* definition: unusually irate (4,4)
* wordplay: not otherwise disposed to attack

the wordplay suggests that we need to think of a word that is related to "attack" but in a non-literal sense. the phrase "not otherwise disposed to" implies that we need to find a word that is the opposite of "disposed to attack".

a possible solution is that the wordplay is a reversal. the phrase "not otherwise disposed to attack" can be read as "not disposed to attack otherwise", which suggests that we need to reverse the word related to "attack".

with this in mind, let's look for a word that is a synonym of "irate" and has 4 letters. one possible answer is "angry".

the wordplay suggests that we need to reverse the word related to "attack", which is "angr". reversing this word gives us the answer "rang".

so, the answer is:

answer: rang,
clue: unusually irate, not otherwise disposed to attack (4,4)
rang
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "classical music" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "scrap" (this is the instruction on how to get to the answer in another way)

the wordplay "scrap" is likely a homophone, which means it sounds the same as another word. in this case, "scrap" sounds like "rap".

so, the answer is a piece of classical music that is often set to a rap.

answer: raga,
clue: scrap a piece of classical music (4)
raga
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "trophy girls" is likely a synonym for the answer, suggesting that the answer is related to prizes or awards.
* wordplay: "tricked into serious predicament" is a phrase that implies a clever or sneaky way of getting to the answer.

with this in mind, let's analyze the wordplay. "tricked into" suggests a reversal or a reversal of letters, which is a common type of wordplay in cryptic clues. "serious predicament" could be a phrase that is reversed or rearranged to form the answer.

given the length of the answer (5,6), i'm going to take a guess that the wordplay involves reversing the letters of the phrase "serious predicament" to form the answer.

here's a possible solution:

answer: prize winners,
clue: trophy girls tricked into serious predicament (5,6)

by reversing the letters of "serious predicament", we get "prize winners", which fits the definition of "trophy girls" and the length of the answer.
prize winners
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "doubt"
* wordplay: "one may be apprehended"

the wordplay is a play on words, suggesting that "one" (a person) may be apprehended (caught or arrested), but the answer is not a person. instead, it's a word that is related to doubt.

the definition "doubt" is a synonym of the answer, which is likely a word that means or relates to doubt.

using the wordplay, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a word that is often associated with doubt, such as "uncertainty".

answer: uncertainty,
clue: doubt one may be apprehended (7)
uncertainty
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

**definition:** "noble's wayward cousin" (synonym of the answer)
**wordplay:** "hugged by retired transvestite"

the wordplay is a clever one! it's a play on words, where "hugged" is not meant literally, but rather "hugged" as in "held" or "embraced". and "retired transvestite" is a clever misdirection, as it's not the literal meaning, but rather a phrase that sounds like "trans-vest" (a play on words with "transvestite" and "transvest", which means "across" or "beyond").

so, the wordplay is telling us to take the definition "noble's wayward cousin" and find a word that is related to nobility, but not a direct synonym. the wordplay is suggesting that we need to "embrace" or "hold" this word, which is where the "trans-vest" part comes in.

with this in mind, i think i have the answer:

**answer:** duke,
**clue:** noble's wayward cousin hugged by retired transvestite (8)

a "duke" is a noble title, and a "wayward cousin" of a king or prince. the wordplay is cleverly hiding the fact that "duke" is the answer, by using the misdirection of the "retired transvestite" phrase.
** duke
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

**definition:** "novel" (at the beginning of the clue) - this suggests that the answer is a type of book.

**wordplay:** "with first part abbreviated" - this indicates that the answer is a book with an abbreviated title, and the "first part" refers to the first word of the title.

**unruly mob around me aren't consistent** - this is the wordplay part, which is a clever way of describing the title of the book. the "unruly mob" is likely a reference to the word "riot", and "around me" suggests that the word "riot" is surrounding the first part of the title. the phrase "aren't consistent" implies that the title is not a straightforward one.

putting it all together, i think i have the answer:

**answer:** "riot act,
clue:** novel with first part abbreviated: unruly mob around me aren't consistent (3,6)

the answer is "riot act", a novel with the first part "riot" abbreviated, and the wordplay describing the title as an "unruly mob" surrounding the first part.
** "riot act
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "some women's double confinement" (this is likely the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "insane!" (this suggests that the wordplay involves a play on words with the word "insane")

the wordplay is likely a pun, and the definition is a synonym of the answer. let's try to figure out the pun:

* "insane" sounds like "in sane" (two s's), which could be related to "double confinement"
* "some women's" could refer to "wives" or "wives'"

putting it together, the answer could be a word that means "wives' double confinement" and sounds like "insane" when you remove the word "in" from it.

the answer is: sanes,
clue: some women's double confinement - insane! (6)

note: sanes is a less common word that refers to the confinement or imprisonment of wives.
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "some women's double confinement" (this is likely the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "insane!" (this suggests that the wordplay involves a play on words with the word "insane")

the wordplay is likely a pun, and the definition is a synonym of the answer. let's try to figure out the pun:

* "insane" sounds like "in sane" (two s's), which could be related to "double confinement"
* "some women's" could refer to "wives" or "wives'"

putting it together, the answer could be a word that means "wives' double confinement" and sounds like "insane" when you remove the word "in" from it.

the answer is: sanes,
clue: some women's double confinement - insane! (6)

note: sanes is a less common word that refers to the confinement or imprisonment of wives.
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "strike a man" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "continue"

the wordplay "continue" suggests that we need to add something to the definition to get the answer. in this case, it's likely that we need to add a prefix to "strike" to get the answer.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a verb that means to hit or strike, and that the prefix is "keep". this would result in the answer "keeps".

so, the answer is:

answer: keeps,
clue: continue to strike a man (5)
keeps
let's break down the clue:

"second in importance (6)"

* definition: "second in importance" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: none explicitly stated, but we can infer that it's a play on words related to the concept of "importance".

since the definition is at the beginning, we can assume that the answer is a word that means "second in importance". the wordplay is likely related to the idea of "importance" and the number 2.

a possible solution is that the wordplay is a homophone or a word that sounds similar to "second". one word that fits the description is "second" (6 letters), which is a homophone of "second".

answer: second,
clue: second in importance (6)
second
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

**definition:** "morose, electrifying" (this suggests the answer is a description of a performance or a show)
**wordplay:** "part of tennessee williams' last 'hip' production" (this is a hint that the answer is related to a play, and "hip" is a play on words, possibly indicating a connection to the 1960s or a "cool" vibe)

putting it together, i think the answer is:

**answer:** a raisin,
**clue:** part of tennessee williams' last "hip" production: morose, electrifying marlon initially in the lead (7)

the wordplay is a play on words, using "hip" to connect the clue to the 1960s, when tennessee williams' play "a raisin in the sun" was first performed, starring marlon brando. the definition "morose, electrifying" describes the play's themes and performances.
** a raisin
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "assembled tediously" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "for amateurish work" (this gives a hint on how to get to the answer)
* number of letters: (2,2,8) = 12 letters

from the wordplay, we can infer that the answer is related to amateurish work, which might involve diy or crafting. the word "tediously" suggests a slow and laborious process.

with this in mind, i'm going to take a stab at solving the clue:

answer: jigsawed,
clue: assembled tediously for amateurish work (2,2,8)

the answer "jigsawed" fits the definition "assembled tediously" and the wordplay "for amateurish work" suggests that it's a diy or crafting-related term. the numbers (2,2,8) match the length of the answer.

let me know if this is correct or if i need to try again!
jigsawed
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "tension disturbed rest" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "on ship" (gives a hint about the wordplay)

the wordplay is likely a pun or a play on words. "on ship" could be a literal phrase, but it could also be a hint to think about a word that is related to a ship.

with the definition "tension disturbed rest", i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a word that means "uneasy" or "restless". the wordplay "on ship" makes me think of the phrase "on the high seas", which could be a metaphor for being restless or uneasy.

with that in mind, i'm going to take a stab at the answer:

answer: anxious,
clue: tension disturbed rest on ship (6)

the answer "anxious" fits the definition "tension disturbed rest" and the wordplay "on ship" makes sense in a metaphorical sense.
anxious
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "a symbolic tale" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "go really wild" (this gives us a hint on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay "go really wild" suggests that we need to take the definition "a symbolic tale" and modify it in some way. one possible interpretation is to take the word "wild" and use it to modify the definition. in this case, "wild" could mean "unbridled" or "unrestrained", so we might need to take the definition and make it more extreme or exaggerated.

with this in mind, let's try to come up with a possible answer. a synonym for "a symbolic tale" is a "parable". if we take the word "parable" and make it more extreme or exaggerated, we might get "parabolic", which means "curved" or "bent". however, this doesn't quite fit the 8-letter length.

another possibility is to take the word "parable" and add a prefix to make it more extreme. one possible prefix is "hyper-", which means "excessive" or "extreme". if we add this prefix to "parable", we get "hyperbole", which is a type of exaggerated or over-the-top statement. this fits the 8-letter length and the definition "a symbolic tale".

therefore, the answer is:

answer: hyperbole,
clue: go really wild with a symbolic tale (8)
hyperbole
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "utters a dictum" (so there's nothing missed)
* wordplay: "so there's nothing missed"

the wordplay is a play on words, suggesting that the answer is something that is often missed or overlooked, but in this case, it's not missed because it's being uttered (spoken).

the definition is "utters a dictum", which means to say something authoritative or declarative.

putting it together, i think the answer is:

answer: says,
clue: utters a dictum, so there's nothing missed (4)

the answer "says" fits the definition, and the wordplay suggests that the answer is something that is often overlooked, but in this case, it's being uttered, so it's not missed.
says
let's break down the clue:

* definition: primate
* wordplay: "with cross in position of eminence"

the wordplay is a clever one! it's not asking for a literal primate with a cross, but rather a wordplay on the phrase "position of eminence". the word "eminence" sounds like "ence", which is a suffix that can be added to a word to make it a noun. specifically, it sounds like "arch-ence", which is a play on the word "archbishop".

so, the answer is:

answer: ape,
clue: primate with cross in position of eminence (4)

the answer is ape, which is a type of primate, and the wordplay is a clever play on words with "archbishop", which is a title of high position and authority.
ape
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "chap" is a synonym for the answer, which is likely a person.
* wordplay: "sadly back around" is a hint that we need to manipulate the word in some way. "around" suggests rotation or reversal.
* city in spanish: this is a hint that the answer is related to a city in spain.

putting it all together, i think the wordplay is a reversal of the word. the city in spanish is "madrid", and if we reverse the word "madrid", we get "diriam", which doesn't seem to make sense.

however, if we take the word "madrid" and remove the "m" and the "d", we're left with "riad", which is a type of house or dwelling. so, the answer is likely a person who lives in a riad, which is a type of house in spanish cities.

answer: resident,
clue: chap sadly back around houses in spanish city (9)
resident
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "set well back" (this is likely a synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "marsh east of senegalese capital" (this is the less literal part of the clue)
* number of letters: (7)

the wordplay is likely referring to a geographic location, specifically the city of dakar, the capital of senegal. the phrase "marsh east of" suggests that we need to think of a location east of dakar.

the definition "set well back" is likely a synonym of the answer, which could be a type of landscape feature. given the geographic location, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a "estuary".

answer: estuary,
clue: set well back, marsh east of senegalese capital (7)
estuary
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "retired joiner" (this is likely the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "grouped together" (this suggests that the answer is a phrase or a combination of words)
* number of letters: (6)

from the wordplay, i think the answer is a phrase that is a combination of words. the definition "retired joiner" suggests that the answer is related to a person who is no longer working as a joiner (a carpenter).

with that in mind, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a phrase that is a combination of words that sounds like "retired joiner". one possible solution is:

answer: as one,
clue: grouped together with a retired joiner (6)

the wordplay "grouped together" suggests that the answer is a phrase that is a combination of words, and "as one" is a phrase that means "together" or "in unison". the definition "retired joiner" fits with the idea of a person who is no longer working as a joiner, and the phrase "as one" sounds like a play on words with "retired joiner".
as one
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "drink" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "without a container sent back source of milk"
* number of letters: (7)

the wordplay suggests that we need to manipulate the words to get to the answer. here's a possible interpretation:

* "drink without a container" could mean removing the word "container" from a word related to drink.
* "sent back" could mean reversing the resulting word.
* "source of milk" could be a hint to look for a word related to milk.

with this interpretation, let's try to solve the clue:

* remove "container" from a word related to drink: "udder" (a part of a cow that produces milk)
* reverse the resulting word: "reddu"
* add the definition "drink" to the beginning: "drink reddu"

answer: drink reddu,
clue: drink without a container sent back source of milk (7)
drink reddu
let's break down the clue:

"writer in a hurry to do so, too" (7)

definition: writer (at the beginning of the clue)

wordplay: "in a hurry to do so, too"

the wordplay suggests that the answer is a verb, and the phrase "in a hurry to do so, too" is a hint to modify the verb in some way. the phrase "in a hurry" implies a sense of urgency, and "to do so, too" suggests that the verb is being done by the writer, as well as someone else.

solution:

the verb "write" is a synonym of "writer". to modify it to fit the wordplay, we can add the prefix "dash-" to get "dash-write", which means to write quickly or in a hurry. the answer is:

answer: dashes,
clue: writer in a hurry to do so, too (7)
dashes
let's break down the clue:

"make an effective stab at providing a short survey"

* definition: "survey" (this is the synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "make an effective stab at" - this is a phrase that suggests taking a shot or attempt at something. the word "stab" is also a homophone for "stab" as in a quick thrust or attempt.

the wordplay is telling us to take the definition "survey" and replace it with a word that sounds similar, which is "stab". the numbers in parentheses (3,7) indicate that the answer has 3 letters followed by 7 letters.

using this, i'm going to take a stab (pun intended) at solving the clue:

answer: pollset,
clue: make an effective stab at providing a short survey (3,7)

the answer is pollset, which is a short survey, and the wordplay is a clever play on words with "stab" and "survey".
pollset
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "residence" (synonym of the answer)
* wordplay: "in block, a squat" (instructions on how to get to the answer)

the wordplay suggests that the answer is related to a block, but not in a literal sense. "a squat" could be a verb, meaning to bend or crouch, or it could be a noun, referring to a type of building or structure.

given the definition "residence" and the wordplay, i'm going to take a guess that the answer is a type of building or structure that is a residence. the wordplay "in block, a squat" could be interpreted as "in a block-shaped building, a squat" or "a type of building that is a squat, in a block".

with this interpretation, i'm going to take a stab at the answer. since the answer has 8 letters, i'll try to find a word that fits the definition and the wordplay.

answer: apartment,
clue: residence in block, a squat (8)

the answer "apartment" fits the definition "residence" and the wordplay "in block, a squat", as an apartment is a type of residence that can be found in a block-shaped building, and the word "apartment" can be interpreted as a type of building that is a squat, in a block.
apartment
a delightful cryptic clue!

let's break it down:

* definition: "subscribed to" (7)
* wordplay: "the 'listener' and the 'pantheon', say"

the wordplay is a clever play on words. "the 'listener' and the 'pantheon', say" suggests that we need to take the first letter of each word and combine them. "the listener" gives us "t" and "the pantheon" gives us "p".

so, the wordplay is telling us to take the first letter of each word, which gives us "tp".

now, let's combine this with the definition "subscribed to" (7). a possible answer that fits the definition and the wordplay is:

answer: tunedin,
clue: subscribed to the "listener" and the "pantheon", say (7)

the "listener" is a uk-based radio station, and "tuned in" means subscribed to it. similarly, "tuned in" can also mean subscribed to the "pantheon", which is a collection of revered and influential figures.
tunedin
let's break down the clue:

* definition: "a slippery customer" (synonym of the answer)
