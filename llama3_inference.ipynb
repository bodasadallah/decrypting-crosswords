      "A delicious-sounding clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Smear\" is a verb that means to spread or apply a substance thinly.\n",
      "* \"pan\" is a cooking vessel.\n",
      "* \"to cook cheese\" suggests that the answer is related to cooking cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I think the clue is hinting at a type of pan that is used to cook cheese, and the answer is a type of cheese that is often cooked in a pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer, PARMESAN, is a type of Italian cheese that is often grated and cooked in a pan to melt and caramelize. The word \"parmesan\" can also be broken down into \"par\" (meaning \"smear\" or \"spread\") and \"mesan\" (a suffix suggesting a type of cheese). This etymological connection adds an extra layer of cleverness to the clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer PARMESAN is a perfect fit for the clue, and I'm sure the constructor of the crossword was delighted to have come up with such a clever and tasty clue!\n",
      "A delightful cryptic crossword clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Agreed\" is a hint that the answer is a phrase that means \"to a certain extent\" or \"to some extent\".\n",
      "* \"Toe\" is a wordplay indicator, suggesting that the answer might involve a word that is related to \"toe\" in some way.\n",
      "* \"Is deformed somewhat\" is a hint that the answer is a phrase that is a play on words, where the word \"deformed\" is used in a non-literal sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look at the answer: TO A DEGREE.\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"To\" is a common prefix that fits with the \"Agreed\" hint, implying a sense of agreement or extent.\n",
      "* \"A\" is a small word that fits with the \"Toe\" hint, as it's a small part of the foot (the big toe, perhaps?).\n",
      "* \"Degree\" is a word that fits with the \"deformed somewhat\" hint, as it's a word that means a measure or extent, but also has a sense of \"to a certain degree\" or \"to some extent\", which matches the \"Agreed\" hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cleverness of the clue lies in the use of wordplay and misdirection. The phrase \"Agreed toe is deformed somewhat\" is a clever way of hinting at the answer without giving it away directly. The solver needs to make connections between the words and phrases to arrive at the solution.\n",
      "What a delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Tricky problem\" suggests that the answer is a type of puzzle or riddle.\n",
      "* \"Brewing\" is a hint that the answer is related to beer, which is a type of beverage.\n",
      "* \"Artisan\" implies that the beer is of a high-quality, craft variety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look at the answer: BRAIN-TEASER.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key insight here is that \"brain-teaser\" is a type of puzzle, which fits the \"tricky problem\" hint. But what about the \"brewing\" and \"artisan\" parts?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer lies in the wordplay. \"Brewing\" can also mean \"to concoct\" or \"to create\", which is what a brewer does when making beer. And \"artisan\" can be shortened to \"art\", which is a prefix that means \"related to\" or \"pertaining to\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer BRAIN-TEASER is a clever play on words. The \"brain\" part refers to the puzzle or riddle, and the \"teaser\" part refers to the brewing or concocting of a craft beer. The \"art\" in \"artisan\" is implied, but not explicitly stated, which adds to the cleverness of the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the answer is a clever combination of wordplay, misdirection, and clever use of language, making it a true \"brain-teaser\" for the solver!\n",
      "A clever clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"POTENTIAL\", but how did I get there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my thought process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The clue mentions \"Promise to fix\", which made me think of a verb related to fixing or repairing something. In this case, the verb is \"POTENTIALLY\", which means \"capable of being done\" or \"able to be fixed\".\n",
      "2. However, the answer is only 9 letters long, so I knew I had to modify the verb to fit the length. I noticed that the word \"POTENTIALLY\" has an extra \"L\" that's not necessary for the meaning. I hypothesized that the answer might be a shortened form of the verb, perhaps dropping the unnecessary letter.\n",
      "3. I tried replacing the extra \"L\" with a more common letter in crossword answers, and \"POTENTIAL\" popped out as a possibility. It fits the 9-letter length, and the word \"POTENTIAL\" is a valid English word that makes sense in the context of fixing a toilet pan (perhaps implying that the toilet has the potential to be fixed).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by combining the idea of a verb related to fixing with the constraints of the answer length and wordplay, I arrived at the answer \"POTENTIAL\".\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Sterile unit\" is a clear hint towards a medical context.\n",
      "* \"Fenced off\" suggests a physical barrier or enclosure.\n",
      "* The answer has 10 letters, which is a good length for a cryptic crossword clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's analyze the answer: \"UNINFECTED\".\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"UN-\" is a prefix meaning \"not\" or \"without\", which fits well with the idea of something being \"sterile\".\n",
      "* \"INFECTED\" is a word that refers to something that has been contaminated or affected by a disease-causing agent. In a medical context, a \"unit\" that is \"infected\" would be a unit that has been contaminated.\n",
      "* By removing the prefix \"IN-\" from \"INFECTED\", we get \"FECTED\", which sounds like \"FENCED\", which fits with the \"fenced off\" part of the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"UNINFECTED\" is a clever play on words, using the prefix \"UN-\" to create a word that is the opposite of \"INFECTED\", while also referencing the idea of a physical barrier or enclosure (the \"fenced off\" part).\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"ABSTAIN\", and here's how I think it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is playing with words, using a clever pun. \"Refuse a black mark\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Refuse\" can mean to decline or reject something, and a \"black mark\" is a negative mark or a stain. In this sense, \"refuse a black mark\" means to decline a stain or a blemish.\n",
      "2. \"Refuse\" can also mean to abstain or avoid something, and a \"black mark\" is a mark of disapproval or shame. In this sense, \"refuse a black mark\" means to abstain from doing something that would earn a black mark or a bad reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"ABSTAIN\" cleverly combines both meanings. \"Abstain\" means to avoid or decline something, which fits the first interpretation. And \"abstain\" also implies avoiding something that would earn a black mark or a bad reputation, which fits the second interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constructor of the crossword likely used a combination of wordplay, clever phrasing, and cleverness to create a clue that is both challenging and clever.\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"MANAGES\" is a clever play on words. Here's how I think the constructor arrived at it:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue says \"Chap gets older but copes\", which suggests that the answer is a verb that means to deal with or handle something. The wordplay is in the phrase \"gets older\", which is a common idiomatic expression meaning \"becomes older\". However, in this case, the constructor is using it to hint at the word \"man\" (a chap) getting older, but also \"manages\" (the verb) to cope with something.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word \"MANAGES\" fits the 7-letter length specified in the clue, and it's a plausible verb that means to handle or deal with something, which fits the context of the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the constructor used a clever play on words, using the multiple meanings of \"gets older\" to lead the solver to the answer \"MANAGES\".\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"IMAGE\", and here's how I arrived at it:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue says \"It may get endless representation\", which is a bit of a mouthful. Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"It\" refers to a noun, which is the answer we're looking for.\n",
      "* \"may get\" is a phrase indicating a possibility or a potential action.\n",
      "* \"endless representation\" is the key part of the clue. \"Endless\" is an adjective that means \"unlimited\" or \"unceasing\", and \"representation\" is a noun that means \"a symbol or a depiction\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I think the clue is hinting at something that can be represented or depicted endlessly. In other words, it's something that can be shown or displayed repeatedly without end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what kind of thing can be represented endlessly? Ah, that's where the word \"IMAGE\" comes in! An image is a visual representation of something, and it can be displayed or shown endlessly, whether it's a photograph, a painting, a logo, or even a digital image on a screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"IMAGE\" fits the bill perfectly. It's a noun that can be represented endlessly, which matches the clue's description.\n",
      "What a delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Magic transport\" is a clear hint that the answer is related to fantasy or supernatural transportation.\n",
      "2. \"Needs fourth of combustion chambers\" is a clever play on words. In a typical combustion engine, there are four cylinders (or chambers) where the fuel-air mixture is ignited to generate power. The phrase \"fourth of combustion chambers\" is a clever way to refer to the number 4.\n",
      "3. \"To run like clockwork\" is another hint that the answer is related to a mechanical or clock-like mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, combining these hints, we can deduce that the answer is a type of magic transport that has 4 combustion chambers, which is a clever play on words. The answer is BROOMSTICK, which is a type of magical transportation often associated with witches and wizards in fantasy fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the \"fourth of combustion chambers\" refers to the fact that a broomstick has four legs (or \"chambers\") that allow it to \"run\" or move smoothly, much like a clockwork mechanism. The phrase \"to run like clockwork\" is a clever way to describe the smooth, efficient motion of a broomstick in flight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a clever and creative clue that requires a good understanding of wordplay, fantasy, and mechanical concepts!\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"WHIRR\", and here's how I think it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is playing with words, using a clever pun. The phrase \"Sound beginning when hummingbird is rapidly returning\" is a clever misdirection. The word \"returning\" has a double meaning here. In one sense, a hummingbird is returning to its nest or a food source. But \"returning\" can also mean \"coming back\" or \"reversing direction\", which is what happens when a hummingbird's wings beat rapidly, creating a whirring or whirring sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"WHIRR\" is a perfect fit, as it's a word that describes the sound of the hummingbird's wings beating rapidly. The clue is using wordplay to create a clever connection between the hummingbird's behavior and the sound it makes, which is the answer to the crossword puzzle.\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"REPEAL\", and I'd be happy to break down how it was obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is a play on words, using a clever combination of wordplay and historical context. Here's how I think the setter arrived at the answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"European power\" refers to a country or state, rather than a physical power or energy source.\n",
      "2. \"Limited by genuine revocation\" is a clever hint. \"Revocation\" is a word that means to cancel or annul something. In this case, the setter is likely referring to the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, a significant event in European history.\n",
      "3. The Edict of Nantes was a decree issued by King Henry IV of France in 1598, granting religious tolerance to French Protestants (Huguenots). However, it was revoked by Louis XIV in 1685, leading to widespread persecution of Huguenots.\n",
      "4. The answer \"REPEAL\" is a clever play on words, as it refers to the act of revoking or canceling something (in this case, the Edict of Nantes). The word \"REPEAL\" is also a homophone of \"REPEAL\", which is a clever connection to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by combining the historical context of the Edict of Nantes with the wordplay on \"REPEAL\", the setter cleverly arrived at the answer \"REPEAL\".\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"NORM\", and here's how I think it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is playing with words, using a clever pun. \"Standard offer of a choice of ends\" is a clever way to phrase it. I believe the answer is a play on words with \"norm\" (a standard or average) and \"norms\" (a type of railway station).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nottingham is a city in the UK, and it has a railway station called Nottingham Station, which has platforms (ends) where trains arrive and depart. The clue is saying that the standard offer of a choice of ends (platforms) at Nottingham Station is a norm (a standard or average).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"NORM\" is a clever play on words, using the multiple meanings of \"norm\" to create a clever and cleverly worded clue!\n",
      "A clever clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"BLASTED\" is a great example of a wordplay-based answer in a cryptic crossword. Here's how it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue says \"Cursed, being literally last in bed\" (7), which is a bit of a mouthful. Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Cursed\" is a hint that the answer is a word that means \"badly affected\" or \"ruined\".\n",
      "* \"being literally last in bed\" is a literal interpretation of the phrase \"last in bed\", which means the person who goes to sleep last. This is where the wordplay comes in.\n",
      "* The word \"BLASTED\" can be interpreted as \"last\" in a sense, as in \"blasted\" as in \"blasted to sleep\", meaning the person who goes to sleep last is \"blasted\" or \"ruined\" (cursed) for the rest of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wordplay is in the use of \"BLASTED\" as a verb, which is not its usual meaning. The answer is not \"BLASTED\" as in \"extremely good\" or \"excellent\", but rather \"BLASTED\" as in \"ruined\" or \"cursed\", which fits the definition of \"cursed\" in the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"BLASTED\" is a clever play on words, using the literal meaning of \"last in bed\" to create a word that fits the definition of \"cursed\".\n",
      "A nice and short one!\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is \"Everyone in short dash for US city\" with a length of 6 letters. The answer is indeed \"DALLAS\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how I think the answer was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Everyone in short\" is a clever play on words. It's not referring to a literal \"everyone\" but rather the abbreviation \"EACH\" (short for \"each one\").\n",
      "* \"Dash\" is a common abbreviation for \"dash\" in American English, which is often used in informal writing.\n",
      "* \"For US city\" is a hint that the answer is a city in the United States.\n",
      "* Putting it all together, \"EACH\" + \"DASH\" + \"US city\" = \"DALLAS\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer is \"DALLAS\" because it's a US city, and the clue is using a clever wordplay to lead to the answer.\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Trap\" is a clear indication that the answer is a noun.\n",
      "* \"surrounded by enchantment\" is a poetic way of saying \"surrounded by a magical or attractive force\".\n",
      "* \"is irresistible\" suggests that the answer is something that has a strong pull or attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I think the clue is hinting at a word that is a type of trap that is surrounded by a magical or attractive force, making it irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer, MAGNETIC, fits perfectly. A magnet is a type of trap that attracts certain materials, and the word itself is surrounded by the concept of enchantment (magnetic fields are often described as having a magical or mysterious quality). The word \"magnetic\" also implies a strong attraction or pull, which fits with the \"irresistible\" part of the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer is MAGNETIC because it's a type of trap that is surrounded by a magical or attractive force, making it irresistible.\n",
      "A nice and simple one!\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is \"Wear out an important part of a car\" and the answer is \"TIRE\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how I would break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Wear out\" is a common phrase that implies something is being used up or exhausted.\n",
      "* \"an important part of a car\" is a hint that the answer is something crucial to the vehicle.\n",
      "* The wordplay is that \"tire\" has a double meaning here. In addition to being a part of a car (the rubber ring that contacts the road), \"tire\" can also mean to exhaust or wear out (e.g., \"I'm tired from running all day\").\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"TIRE\" fits both meanings of the clue, making it a clever and cleverly worded crossword puzzle clue!\n",
      "A nice short and sweet one!\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is \"Encouraging sign from sleepy land?\" and the answer is \"NOD\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how I think the answer was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Sleepy land\" is a play on words, referring to the phrase \"Dreamland\", which is a common idiomatic expression for a state of deep sleep or a dreamy state.\n",
      "* \"Encouraging sign\" is a hint that the answer is a positive or uplifting gesture.\n",
      "* \"NOD\" is a common gesture of encouragement or approval, where one nods their head up and down to indicate agreement or assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"NOD\" is a clever play on words, using the idea of \"sleepy land\" to lead to the answer, which is a common encouraging sign.\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"GOODNESS\" is a straightforward one, but let's break it down to see how it fits the clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is \"My virtue\", which suggests that the answer is a quality or a characteristic that is considered good or virtuous. The word \"GOODNESS\" fits this description perfectly, as it is a noun that refers to the quality of being good or virtuous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cryptic crosswords, the answer is often a wordplay on the clue, and in this case, the wordplay is a straightforward one. The clue is simply asking for a word that means \"goodness\", and the answer is a perfect fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer \"GOODNESS\" is obtained by taking the clue literally and looking for a word that matches the description \"My virtue\".\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"TERMS\" is a clever play on words. The clue \"Stipulations for academic periods\" is a bit ambiguous, but the wordplay is in the fact that \"terms\" can refer to both the stipulations or conditions of something, as well as the periods of time in an academic year (e.g., \"spring term\", \"summer term\", etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the constructor of the crossword is using a clever pun to create a connection between the two meanings of \"terms\". The answer \"TERMS\" is a perfect fit for the clue, as it satisfies both meanings: \"stipulations\" (the conditions or rules) and \"academic periods\" (the terms of the academic year).\n",
      "\n",
      "Well done, constructor!\n",
      "A nice and short one!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer \"SECOND\" is obtained by applying a common cryptic crossword technique called \"definition-led wordplay\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue \"Back in a short while\" is a definition, which is a straightforward description of the answer. The wordplay is hidden in the phrase \"Back in a short while\", where \"Back\" is a hint towards the word \"SECOND\", which is a unit of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cryptic crosswords, \"Back\" is often used as a wordplay indicator, which means that the answer is a word that is related to the definition, but not necessarily a direct translation. In this case, \"Back\" is indicating that the answer is a word that is related to time, and \"SECOND\" fits perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the solver needs to recognize the wordplay and connect the dots between the definition and the answer, which is \"SECOND\".\n",
      "A clever clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"TYPO\", and here's how I think it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is playing with words, using a clever pun. \"Error concealed\" is a hint that the answer is a type of error, and \"by city police\" is a red herring to distract from the true meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key is to recognize that \"city police\" sounds like \"type-o\", which is a common abbreviation for \"typo\", a type of error in writing. The \"4\" at the end of the clue indicates that the answer is a 4-letter word, which fits perfectly with \"TYPO\".\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the constructor of the crossword cleverly used a wordplay to conceal the answer, making it a fun and challenging puzzle to solve!\n",
      "What a delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed RAVIOLI, and here's how I arrived at it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The clue mentions \"Soft cases used by opera violinists\". This suggests that the answer is related to violin cases, but with a twist. Opera violinists are known for their classical music performances, and \"soft cases\" implies a specific type of case.\n",
      "2. The length of the answer is 7 letters, which helps to narrow down the possibilities.\n",
      "3. I looked for words related to violin cases that fit the 7-letter length. One possibility that came to mind was \"CASES\", but it didn't quite fit the \"soft\" description.\n",
      "4. Then, I thought about other words that could be related to violin cases and the word \"ravioli\" popped up. Ravioli is a type of Italian pasta dish, but it also sounds similar to \"ravioli\" (with an extra \"i\" at the end). This made me wonder if the answer could be a play on words.\n",
      "5. I checked the word \"RAVIOLI\" against the clue, and it fits perfectly. The word \"ravioli\" is indeed a type of soft, folded pasta, and it's not a direct reference to a violin case. However, the wordplay is clever, as it uses the word \"ravioli\" to describe a soft case used by opera violinists, which is a clever and unexpected twist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer is RAVIOLI, and it's a great example of a clever cryptic crossword clue that requires lateral thinking and wordplay to solve!\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed \"TENOR\", and here's how I arrived at it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The clue mentions \"Singer in first ENO Rigoletto\", which suggests that the answer is related to the opera \"Rigoletto\" and the English National Opera (ENO).\n",
      "2. \"Rigoletto\" is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, and it's a well-known fact that the main character, the Duke of Mantua, is a tenor role.\n",
      "3. The answer is 5 letters long, which is a common length for a cryptic crossword answer.\n",
      "4. The wordplay in the clue is likely to be a straightforward reference to the fact that the answer is a type of singer, and the word \"TENOR\" fits the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by combining these pieces of information, I deduced that the answer is indeed \"TENOR\", which is a type of singer and a fitting answer given the context of the clue.\n",
      "A clever clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is indeed ANARCHIST, and here's how it was obtained:\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is playing with words, using a clever pun. \"Section of Norman arch\" is a literal description of the answer, but it's also a clever misdirection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Norman arch\" refers to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, which brought French influence to the English language. The word \"arch\" can also mean a type of architectural feature, but in this case, it's being used to create a wordplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase \"thrown into disorder\" is a hint that the answer is related to chaos or upheaval, which is a key characteristic of anarchism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, by combining the literal meaning of \"Norman arch\" with the wordplay on \"arch\" and the hint about disorder, the solver arrives at the answer ANARCHIST, which is a clever and unexpected solution.\n",
      "A delightful clue!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is LINDA, and I'm happy to break down how it was obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue is \"In Berlin, dainty girl (5)\", which is a play on words. The phrase \"In Berlin\" is a hint that the answer is related to the city of Berlin, and \"dainty girl\" is a description of the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to solving this clue is to recognize that \"LINDA\" is a common German name, and \"LINDA\" is also an anagram of the phrase \"IN LAD\", which is a clever play on words. The phrase \"In Berlin\" is essentially \"IN LAD\" spelled backwards, which leads to the answer LINDA.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the solver needs to recognize the anagram and the wordplay to arrive at the correct answer, LINDA.\n"
