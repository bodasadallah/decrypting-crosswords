    "# ### Respones\n",
    "# 1. **Recognize the Clue Structure**:\n",
    "# • Cryptic clues usually consist of a definition and a wordplay. The definition provides a synonym or description of the answer, and the wordplay gives a way to derive it.\n",
    "# 2. **Identify the Definition**:\n",
    "# • Look for a part of the clue that could be the definition. Here, “somewhat” is a hint that the answer means “to some extent” or “to a degree”.\n",
    "# 3. **Analyze the Wordplay**:\n",
    "# • The phrase “agreed toe is deformed” suggests some manipulation of the letters in “agreed toe”.\n",
    "# • The word “deformed” is a common indicator of an anagram in cryptic crosswords.\n",
    "# 4. **Consider the Length Indicator**:\n",
    "# • The numbers (2,1,6) indicate that the answer is a phrase composed of a 2-letter word, a 1-letter word, and a 6-letter word.\n",
    "# 5. **Form the Anagram**:\n",
    "# • Rearrange the letters of “agreed toe” to match the structure (2,1,6).\n",
    "# • Write out the letters: A, G, R, E, E, D, T, O, E.\n",
    "# 6. **Try Possible Combinations**:\n",
    "# • Focus on forming a phrase that fits the pattern (2,1,6) and makes sense in the context of “somewhat”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • Break it down:\n",
    "# • 2-letter word: “to”\n",
    "# • 1-letter word: “a”\n",
    "# • 6-letter word: “degree”\n",
    "# 7. **Verify the Anagram**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • Check if “agreed toe” can be rearranged to form “to a degree”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • Letters in “agreed toe”: A, G, R, E, E, D, T, O, E\n",
    "\n",
    "# • Letters in “to a degree”: T, O, A, D, E, G, R, E, E\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Confirm the Solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • All letters match, and the phrase “to a degree” means “somewhat”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The phrase “to a degree” fits the length indicator (2,1,6).\n",

    "\n",
    "# **Step-by-Step Chain of Thoughts:**\n",
    "# 1. **Recognize the Clue Structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The clue typically consists of a definition and wordplay. Here, the definition and wordplay are interwoven.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Identify the Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The word “Cursed” can be the definition, meaning the solution should be a synonym for “cursed”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Analyze the Wordplay**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The phrase “being literally last in bed” suggests that there is something related to the position of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Break Down the Phrase**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • Focus on the word “bed” and consider how “last in bed” could relate to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The word “last” suggests that we are looking at the final letter of “bed”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Final Letter of “bed”**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The final letter of “bed” is “d”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Form the Solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The word “blasted” means “cursed” and fits the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • “Blasted” contains the letter “d” (the last letter of “bed”).\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The phrase “being literally last in bed” is a hint to include “d” at the end of the word, leading to “blasted”.\n",
    "# **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# The solution to the cryptic crossword clue “Cursed, being literally last in bed (7)” is “blasted” because:\n",
    "\n",
    "# • “Cursed” is the definition of “blasted”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The wordplay “being literally last in bed” suggests taking the final letter “d” from “bed”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# • The word “blasted” fits the definition and the length indicator (7).\n",
